# Generator-Password
This code is for generating passwords for accounts.

# Libraries used
random,
string,
os.

# How to begin
1. Importing libraries:
   Before using the code, make sure the required libraries are installed. The code uses the `random`, `string`, and `os` libraries, which are standard Python libraries and are usually available by default.

2. Define the `generate_password(length)` function:
   This function is responsible for generating a secure random password based on the provided length. It uses uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols to create a complex password.

3. Define the `save_password_to_txt(name, password)` function:
   This function is responsible for saving the generated password to a .txt file with the name provided by the user. The file will be saved in the current directory where the Python script is being executed.

4. Request the password length from the user:
   The application starts by asking the user to enter the desired password length. The user should provide an integer value.

5. Request the user's name for whom the password will be generated:
   Next, the code prompts the user to enter the name for whom the password will be generated. The name is used to create the name of the .txt file where the password will be saved.

6. Generate the password:
   Based on the length provided by the user, the `generate_password()` function is called to generate a random password.

7. Display the generated password:
   The generated password is displayed on the screen.

8. Save the password in a .txt file:
   The `save_password_to_txt()` function is called to save the generated password in a .txt file with the name provided by the user.

9. Conclusion:
   After execution, the code will generate a random password and save it in a .txt file with the name provided by the user. The user can use this password as needed for their purposes.
